# Reporting and Fixing Security Issues

Do not open issues or pull requests - this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors. Please report potential security issues in this project through the Airbnb Bug Bounty program:

[https://hackerone.com/airbnb](https://hackerone.com/airbnb)

Airbnb’s team will triage and address all valid issues. You may be eligible for a bounty if the report is valid under our program.
